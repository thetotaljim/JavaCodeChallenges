> These are code challenges done for practice and fun!

The first code challenge is FizzBuzz. The requirement is to print numbers 1-100, but with these rules:
- if a number is a multiple of 3, print Fizz
- if a number is a multiple of 5, print Buzz
- if a number is a multiple of both, print FizzBuzz
- if a number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, then print the number.

I used a loop to generate the numbers, and separate function to test the number and return a string response to be printed. 
This is in the FizzBuzz.java file.  I also have FizzBuzzTest.java, which does a JUnit test on the string response method to 
test that it returns the correct values.  

Thanks for checking it out!
